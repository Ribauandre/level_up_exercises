# Level Up Exercises

These are the combined exercises used at http://leveluprails.com. You can do them out of sequence, but you'll probably be missing the point. Do the right thing, visit the [site](http://leveluprails.com).

## Your Submissions Welcome

When you finish an exercise, feel free to make a pull request back into this repo if you'd like some feedback on your code. As soon as I get the chance, I'll make PR comments to provide some guidance as well. There's no catch here -- give it a shot. ðŸ‘Š Joe

## How to Do These Exercises

1. Fork this repo into your own space
2. Wait until you're asked to do one of the exercises
3. Use your fork, develop code, push it back upward
4. Profit!

## The First Lesson

Like everything else in the world, these exercises have errors and problems and typos. We experience this problem whenever we code, and the only way to stay sane as a group is to fix problems as we find them. Be a mensch, send pull requests.
